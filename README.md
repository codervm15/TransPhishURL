Build a Transformers Models-based framework that can handle both numerical-based Lexical features and Textual features of URL and classify it as malicious/non-malicious.
Build a new approach to form feature strings, to handle numerical data using Transformers.
Tried different transformer models for the performance comparative study.
Used three different public datasets- PhishTank, GitHub Data, and Kaggle data to verify the approach.
Also optimized all the models to avoid overfitting, by using early stopping mechanism, etc
Received SOTA results on all datasets.
